This is the very beginning of our tech blog, in future posts will be sharing our experiences of Sysco's digital transformation journey.
The first posts will be focused on breaking monolithic enterprise applications into smaller chunks by incrementally adopting [microservices architecture][msa-wikipedia].
While there are tons of articles and books about microservices, most of them explore the topic from the greenfield project perspective.
We think that there will be a lot of learning on our own in the topic of transforming a large traditional enterprise application architecture into the microservices way of building, deploying, testing and releasing apps.
